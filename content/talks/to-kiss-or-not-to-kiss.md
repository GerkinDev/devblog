Recently, a coworker posted a tweet about relation between experience & simplicity, with the passive-aggressive caption "*je dis ca je dis rien*" ("*just saying*"):

I felt a bit attacked by this, since I know that I tend to complexify things a bit and play around, and it made me think.

* Continuous learning
* Place in production code
  * If it's understandable, why not ?
  * Mutualize tech auto-formation & actual work
    Easier to contribute to external packages or deep dive in 3rd party code
* API surface layer
  * backward compatibility
* We're human ! This can be fun

[*RSA* (*`R`ivest–`S`hamir–`A`dleman*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) is an *asymmetric encryption* protocol, widely used in the tech world because of its robustness. It is one of the central pieces of [*TLS* (_`T`ransport `L`ayer `S`ecurity_) and its predecessor, *SSL* (_`S`ecure `S`ocket `L`ayer_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)

What does *asymmetric encryption* means ? It is opposed to the *symmetric encryption*, where the same key can be used to encode and decode data. In *asymmetric encryption*, there are 2 keys, and each of those keys can encrypt messages, and decode messages encrypted by the other key.

*RSA* is also able to give a proof that you are actually talking with the right person, preventing [*Man-In-The-Middle* attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack), if you use it correctly.

While the 2 points above are super great for security and privacy, they come also with some drawbacks: generating, manipulating and using RSA keys can be a bit confusing, and that's why I'm writing this article.

See this article like a personal guide I publish in case it can help someone. It is not meant to be precise or exhaustive.

## File formats

As said above, [*RSA*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) being an *asymmetric encryption* protocol, it must have 2 different keys. But to support more security methods, like [*Man-In-The-Middle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) prevention, there are other file formats, each with its own use. Let's explain the most common of them.

### `.key`: The private `key`

The private key is one of the 2 keys mentioned above, that is meant to be used by the server.

{{<alert theme="danger">}}
As its name suggests, this file is **super** critical: anyone having this can decode messages that are sent to you, encrypted with your [public key](#pub-the-public-key).

You should **never __ever__** send it to untrusted party. Other people should have the [public key](#pub-the-public-key).
{{</alert>}}

#### What does it contains ?

A "*simple*" [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) string with a distinguishing header to identify it as a private key. It looks like this:

```
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIBOwIBAAJBANM6etMEO+MNxAYEEUZeFqPdfm+ng0MS9HqObHWqMIoUPG4pSYyq
MgTunrhUdYpkF+pWntT4o6OUIQ00XFavNQ8CAwEAAQJAHJDZEXaOHsu6ydF9AJYy
26BVvAXcc5K5q2Vdd6A3hkStZ6LdJvwISKgCl1sUM17v7pO5kYIU46UioxC5mlDR
mQIhAO8md6mejmATo2fEit3D3kWhHRGl....
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

The random stuff in the middle has a length depending on the *modulus* of the key, measured in *bits* (not *bytes*).

#### How to make one ?

```sh
openssl genrsa -out test.key 2048
```

Here, `2048` is the modulus. To be considered safe until 2030, it is recommended to be [at least 2048 *bits*](https://www.javamex.com/tutorials/cryptography/rsa_key_length.shtml) (so 256 *bytes*). But if computation is not a problem, don't hesitate to go for 4096 *bits*. Without misplaced analogy, keep in mind that the larger, the better :grin:.

#### How to inspect ?

```sh
openssl rsa -text -in foo.key
```

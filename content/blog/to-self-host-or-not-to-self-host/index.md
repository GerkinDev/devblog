    Why to self host

    - Feeling the impact of our needs
    - Scaling the needs
    - Pricing independence
    - Decentralization and initiative promotion
    - It's fun

    What not to self host

    - need of reliability
    - services interacting with many others

I wont go into the details of the tools I ended up using (I may make a dedicated post about that later on), but the overall philosophy, and why I believe it is a move to make.

## The Why

### Freedom and privacy

<!--
- Vendor lock-in (google photos) that can force us into subscriptions
- Sovereignty, data at home
- Minimalism and simplicity
-->

I do not want to _trust_ any of the big players to respect the privacy of my data. I know that there are laws to protect against these unregulated usages, but let's not lie to ourselves: you know how (not) willingly most companies apply such rules. Most of them rely on some kind of monetization over user information, being Netflix or YouTube with their adds, [LinkedIn allegedly using messages for AI training](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxevpzy3yko), ... <!-- TODO find more -->

For the companies that I trust, I still keep in mind that most of them have a huge target in their back, due to the massive impact a data breach can have. Obviously, building a self-hosted architecture as secure as what Alphabet has is impossible; but I need to _be_ the target to be affected.

Those cloud tools, 0 config, free or cheap are _extremely_ efficient at becoming unquestioned. And someday... Someday, your favorite VoD service increase the price of its plans to an excessive amount, or some chat service changes its age verification process to force user data collection. But you're so accustomed to it that switching is hardly an option.
I'm not saying that I don't like these services; they're just too convenient. But for the ones you choose to self host, you also _choose_ the artifact you'll run, with its behavior as is, that won't change without your consent, and the features you want it into.

### The customization

### Learning is fun

## The What

## The Fuck

Yeah, that's a shitty joke related to the previous section's title... Sorry
